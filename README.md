# Equigrade: A more hoslitic Grading System
![alt text](https://github.com/SekenderNaveed1/Equigrade/blob/main/Logo.png)
Equigrade is designed to transform educational assessment by introducing a flexible, comprehensive grading system that adapts to the nuances of student performance. Its goal is to simplify the grading process while ensuring accuracy and fairness in evaluation.

# What is Equigrade?
Equigrade is an innovative grading system designed to enhance the way educators assess student performance. At its core, Equigrade provides flexibility and accuracy in grading, allowing for the substitution and adjustment of grades based on predefined rules or instructor discretion. This system is built to reflect a student's true capabilities by considering their overall performance rather than just isolated outcomes.

# Equigrade's key features include:

Grade Substitution: If a student performs poorly on one assignment but improves on a similar one later, Equigrade can substitute the latter grade for the former, ensuring the grading reflects the student's learning curve.
Holistic Assessment: By taking into account the entirety of a student's work, Equigrade promotes a more comprehensive view of their knowledge and skills.
Customizable Settings: Instructors can adjust the system to fit their specific grading criteria, making Equigrade versatile across different subjects and teaching methods.
Integration with Canvas: Designed to work seamlessly with the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS), Equigrade ensures a smooth user experience for both instructors and students.

While Equigrade aims to be broadly applicable, we recognize the uniqueness of each educational context and welcome contributions to make this tool even better.

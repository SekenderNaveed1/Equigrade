# Equigrade: A more hoslitic Grading System
![alt text](https://github.com/SekenderNaveed1/Equigrade/blob/main/Logo.png)
Equigrade is designed to transform educational assessment by introducing a flexible, comprehensive grading system that adapts to the nuances of student performance. Its goal is to simplify the grading process while ensuring accuracy and fairness in evaluation.

# What is Equigrade?
Equigrade is an innovative grading system designed to enhance the way educators assess student performance. At its core, Equigrade provides flexibility and accuracy in grading, allowing for the substitution and adjustment of grades based on predefined rules or instructor discretion. This system is built to reflect a student's true capabilities by considering their overall performance rather than just isolated outcomes.

# Equigrade's key features include:

Here's a more detailed, straightforward explanation of its key features:

### Grade Substitution for Improved Learning: 
Equigrade recognizes that learning is a process filled with ups and downs. To reflect a student's growth over time, if a student initially struggles with a concept but later shows improvement on a similar assignment, Equigrade allows for the replacement of the earlier lower grade with the later, higher one. This substitution acknowledges and rewards the student's progress and mastery over time, rather than penalizing them for earlier challenges.

### Comprehensive Evaluation of Student Work: 
Unlike traditional grading systems that may focus narrowly on individual assignments, Equigrade adopts a holistic view. It considers all aspects of a student's work throughout a course, ensuring that the final grade accurately represents their overall understanding and skills. This approach encourages students to consistently engage with all course material, knowing that each piece of work contributes to their final assessment.

### Flexible and Customizable Grading Options: 
Understanding that each course and instructor has unique needs, Equigrade is designed with flexibility at its core. Instructors can tailor the system's settings to align with their specific grading standards and objectives. This includes adjusting which assignments can be substituted, setting grade thresholds for substitutions, and choosing how penalties for late or missing work are applied. This adaptability makes Equigrade suitable for a wide range of subjects and instructional styles.

### Seamless Integration with Canvas: 
To ensure a smooth and hassle-free experience for both instructors and students, Equigrade is built to integrate seamlessly with Canvas, a popular Learning Management System (LMS). This integration means that users can easily navigate between Equigrade and Canvas, with grades and assignments automatically synced between the two platforms. The result is a streamlined workflow that saves time and reduces the potential for errors.

# Motivation & roadmap

Well, I guess this will probably be the most casual section of this readme, but it's for a reason. The main motivation behind this project began in the Fall of 2022 at UC Davis. I was a student assistant for Matthew Butner (co-creator) of this project. We were working on an entry-level class called [ECS 32A]([url](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/schedules-classes/ecs-032a-introduction-programming)), which is a very basic Python course for beginners.

Unfortunately, we discovered a trend that a significant portion of the class either failed or performed very poorly. So, in December 2022, Professor Butner took the initiative and organized a team to help brainstorm ideas for creating a grade-enhancement algorithm for classes that are mostly project-based, like his. I was fortunate enough to be part of that team, and we worked on and off, with hour-long brainstorming sessions for around 6 months. However, in the end, I remained on the team, and in the summer, Professor Butner and I both agreed on a concept like Equigrade. However, we had one problem: we didn't have enough people for this project. It was just me and him.

I was concurrently interning at LLNL and still am, actually. I realized that one thing I really wanted to do was project management, and I pitched the idea to him, and he gave me the green light. This was in August 2023. I decided to ask around as many people as I could, friends, classmates, etc. The response was quite nice. In the end, at the height of the project, I had around 20 people on this team. We had team members with incredibly impressive backgrounds, from interning at big tech companies and being much better at coding than me, to people who were just getting started with a CS degree. And yes, that was the point of all this. I wanted to give people something legitimate to work on for their resume, to learn, and to have others work on something fun too on the side.

I created a couple of different teams for this project. For this phase, the two primary ones that had to execute were the Development Team and the QA Team. The names and responsibilities are self-explanatory; the developers created, and QA did debugging, etc.

The development timeframe of this project took around 3 months, from August 2023 to December 2023.

The roadmap that I would love for this project is for it to be used by UC Davis faculty, especially the CS department and then other departments, while concurrently reaching other schools that use Canvas. I wholeheartedly believe that this project has the potential to make learning, to some degree, much more equitable and grades more holistic - hence the name, Equigrade.

This was the first project I ever managed, and I hope it is just the beginning of many others to follow that are much larger in scale and with larger real-world ramifications.

Thank you. :)

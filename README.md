README for Equigrade

Hey there! If you are confused about what equigrade is, you'll find this guide super handy. I'm going to walk you through Equigrade – an awesome grading system that's all about flexibility and fairness. Trust me, it's not your typical, rigid grade tracker. So, let's dive in!

What is Equigrade?

Equigrade is a revolutionary grading system that's designed to reflect a student's performance more accurately. It's not just about the numbers; it's about understanding and adapting to different learning styles and progress. It's cool because it allows for grade substitutions and adjustments, which means if you had a bad day on one assignment, it's not the end of the world!
Core Concepts

Grade Blueprint: This is like the backbone of Equigrade. It sets out how grades can be adjusted or substituted. Think of it as a flexible guideline rather than a strict rulebook.

Global Settings: Here’s where the magic happens! You can set things like:
        Max Substitutions Allowed (up to 15!)
        Grade Thresholds for Substitution (usually between 15 and 70, but you can tweak this)
        Penalty Types and Amounts (to keep things fair, but not too harsh)

Assignment Guidelines: Every assignment can have a substitute, either another assignment or an aggregate of others. Methods include average, weighted average, max, min, median, and custom calculations. Plus, you can assign different weightings.

Why Equigrade? 

    Holistic Assessment: It's all about the big picture. Equigrade ensures your overall performance is what counts, not just one-off scores.

    Flexibility: You get to customize grading criteria. This means it aligns with different teaching styles and course demands.

    Integration with Canvas: It’s super user-friendly and works seamlessly with Canvas, which most of us are already using.

    Consistent Engagement: It encourages you not to skip assignments, as they all contribute to your final grade. Keeps you on your toes!

Getting Started with Equigrade:
Setting up Equigrade is pretty straightforward. You'll need to:

    Check out the SETUP.md for detailed instructions.
    Install any dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
    Initialize the system using the setup.py script.

How It Works

    Equigrade uses a JSON structure (see data.json) to manage the grade blueprint.
    Various Python scripts handle different parts of the grading process, like assignment_data.py, avg.py, max.py, and many more.
    User interactions, settings, data parsing, and feature implementation are all taken care of within these scripts.

Final Thoughts
Equigrade is like having a super flexible, understanding TA who gets that sometimes life happens. It's about making sure your grades reflect your effort and knowledge over the whole term, not just your worst or best day. Plus, it’s easy to use and integrates with tools we're already familiar with.

So, whether you're a student worried about that one bad grade tanking your GPA, or a teacher looking for a fairer way to assess your class, Equigrade is definitely worth checking out. It’s by students, for students – and it shows.
